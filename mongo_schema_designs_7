Denormalizing from One -> Many

You can also denormalize fields from the “One” side into the “Many” side:

> db.parts.findOne()
{
    _id : ObjectID('AAAA'),
    partno : '123-aff-456',
    name : '#4 grommet',
    product_name : 'left-handed smoke shifter',   // Denormalized from the ‘Product’ document
    product_catalog_number: 1234,                     // Ditto
    qty: 94,
    cost: 0.94,
    price: 3.99
}

However, if you’ve denormalized the Product name into the Part document, 
then when you update the Product name you must also update every place 
it occurs in the ‘parts’ collection. This is likely to be a more expensive 
update, since you’re updating multiple Parts instead of a single Product. 
As such, it’s significantly more important to consider the read-to-write 
ratio when denormalizing in this way.
