Intermediate: Denormalizing With “One-To-Squillions” Relationships

You can also denormalize the “one-to-squillions” example. This works 
in one of two ways: you can either put information about the “one” 
side (from the 'hosts’ document) into the “squillions” side (the log entries),
 or you can put summary information from the “squillions” side into the “one” side.

Here’s an example of denormalizing into the “squillions” side. 
I’m going to add the IP address of the host (from the ‘one’ side) into the individual log message:

> db.logmsg.findOne()
{
    time : ISODate("2014-03-28T09:42:41.382Z"),
    message : 'cpu is on fire!',
    ipaddr : '127.66.66.66',
    host: ObjectID('AAAB')
}

Your query for the most recent messages from a particular IP address just got easier: 
it’s now just one query instead of two.

> last_5k_msg = db.logmsg.find({ipaddr : '127.66.66.66'}).sort({time : -1}).limit(5000).toArray()
