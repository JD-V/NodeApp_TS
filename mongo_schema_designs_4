Intermediate: Two-Way Referencing

If you want to get a little bit fancier, 
you can combine two techniques and include both styles of reference in your schema, 
having both references from the “one” side to the “many” side and references from the
“many” side to the “one” side.

db.person.findOne()
{
    _id: ObjectID("AAF1"),
    name: "Kate Monster",
    tasks [     // array of references to Task documents
        ObjectID("ADF9"), 
        ObjectID("AE02"),
        ObjectID("AE73") 
        // etc
    ]
}


db.tasks.findOne()
{
    _id: ObjectID("ADF9"), 
    description: "Write lesson plan",
    due_date:  ISODate("2014-04-01"),
    owner: ObjectID("AAF1")     // Reference to Person document
}

This design has all of the advantages and disadvantages of the “One-to-Many” schema,
but with some additions. Putting in the extra ‘owner’ reference into the Task document 
means that its quick and easy to find the Task’s owner, but it also means that if you 
need to reassign the task to another person, you need to perform two updates instead 
of just one. Specifically, you’ll have to update both the reference from the Person 
to the Task document, and the reference from the Task to the Person.
